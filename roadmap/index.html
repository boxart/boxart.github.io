            <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BoxArt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">BoxArt-Boiler</code> are both under active development. This list represents some of the anticipated capabilities and features that will be coming to the library and the boilerplate; we welcome you to get involved in our planning process or participate in feature development through <a href="http://waffle.io/boxart/boxart-boiler">our boxart-boiler waffle board</a>.</p>

<h3 id="planned-boxart-core-components--capabilities">Planned BoxArt core components &amp; capabilities</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BoxArt</code> defines presentation-agnostic helpers for structuring common types of layout, interaction and data management that can occur in games.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drag-and-Drop - Special case Animated to drag elements around. We don’t want to DnD data, we want to DnD data’s representation.</li>
  <li>Sprite Animation</li>
  <li>Anchor - Make two Anchors, the second will be positioned on top of the first.</li>
  <li>Runloop - Pausable and controllable timeouts. Create a set of timeouts and pause and resume them together.</li>
  <li>Keyboard - Help map on screen Actions so that WASD can focus actions in a many dimensional menu or tiles in a grid based game or etc.</li>
  <li>Batch - Update elements when their data changes. Helps React diff by explicitly saying parts that did and didn’t update.</li>
  <li>BatchFactory - Creates Multiple Batch elements from one data object.</li>
  <li>Data helpers - example structures demonstrating how game data and state may be efficiently managed, updated, and queried. Examples may include
    <ul>
      <li>An Index helper, which could be used in a grid-based game to map the x,y grid to data items: “What is at postion x,y?”</li>
      <li>A State helper, which would hold a slice of immutable data and build up a the next state transactionally. The future state is mutable until it becomes the current state.</li>
      <li>A Struct helper, which could view a member of State and return the future mutation (if present) or the current immutable data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ActionLite - A non-skinned Action for which boxart-boiler would provide skins.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="planned-boxart-boiler-helper-components">Planned BoxArt Boiler helper components</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BoxArt-Boiler</code> provides skins and themes to give <code class="highlighter-rouge">BoxArt</code> components visible form, and provides less-generalizable components to handle more game-specific game tasks. The boilerplate also provides an existing scaffold and build process for <code class="highlighter-rouge">BoxArt</code>-derived games.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Clamp</code> - Set a fixed aspect ratio for an element.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Action</code> - Make element focusable and actionable. Can be used to make buttons, or to make game characters interactive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="webpack-plugins--asset-packaging-pipelines">Webpack plugins &amp; asset packaging pipelines</h3>

<p>Asset management and efficient resource packaging and deployment are essential components for a smooth development process and quality user experience for web games. Several <a href="https://webpack.github.io">Webpack</a> components are under development that will streamline how assets (images, sound and more) can be packaged and loaded within games.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sound pipeline</li>
  <li>Image pipeline</li>
</ul>
